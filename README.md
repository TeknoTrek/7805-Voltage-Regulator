# 7805 Voltage Regulator
 This repository contains all the files necessary to design and simulate a 7805 voltage regulator circuit. The 7805 is a popular linear voltage regulator that provides a stable 5V output from a higher input voltage (typically 7-35V). It’s commonly used in electronics projects to power microcontrollers, sensors, and other components that require a reliable 5V supply.
